# Materials

- A Raspberry Pi
  - USB to micro USB cord
  - GPIO output pins
- ExplorerHAT module
- Raspi Camera
  - Raspi Camera ribbon
- Two motors
  - Motor connection wires
- Two wheels
- Portable power bank

# Building the parts

1. Solder the ExplorerHAT module to the Raspi. Also add GPIO outputs to Raspi.

2. Wire & solder the motors if needed(our motors came pre-soldered)
3. Add camera module to the Raspi using the camera ribbon.
4. Glue wheels to the motor. We used a glue gun to attatch the wheels on the white part of the motors.
5. Attatch motors to the ExplorerHAT motor input and outputs. The red wire goes in the positive and the black goes in the negative.

# Create car base
1. Measure the dimensions of the motors + wheels, Raspi, the power bank and any other necessary objects.
2. Create a 3D print design of the buggy using the measurements.
3. Print the 3D model.

# Coding
Code buggy movements by using a computer to access the Raspi.
The python code file for this project can be found in the raspibuggyproject repository.

# Put Everthing together
1. Place all necessary objects in the car base.
2. Make sure the car base is secure.

# What to do with your Raspi buggy
Have fun with your new creation!
